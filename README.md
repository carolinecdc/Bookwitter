# Web Application Description: Book Review

## Overview
The application is a book review that allows users to create, edit, and delete reviews of books they have read. Users can sign up, log in using email or social media accounts (Google and Facebook), and interact with reviews and profiles of other users. The platform aims to facilitate community discussions around books through reviews and comments.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (with local, Google, and Facebook strategies)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for hashing passwords
- **Environment Configuration**: dotenv for managing environment variables
- **Data Validation**: express-validator
- **Frontend Templating**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
- **API Integration**: Axios for fetching book data from external APIs (Open Library)

## Key Features
### User Authentication
- Users can register with their email, and a username is automatically generated to ensure uniqueness.
- Login functionality supports both traditional email/password authentication and OAuth via Google and Facebook.

### Session Management
- User sessions are managed using express-session, allowing users to stay logged in across multiple visits.

## Application Structure
### Routing
The application uses routes to handle various functionalities:
- `/:` Home page displaying a list of books and their reviews.
- `/review-create`: Form to create a new book review (requires authentication).
- `/review/:index`: Displays an individual book review along with its comments.
- `/profile`: Shows the userâ€™s profile and their reviews.
- `/login`, `/register`: Pages for user authentication.

### Database Schema
- **Users table** for storing user information (name, email, password, username).
- **Books table** for storing book details (title, author, review, rating, user_id).
- **Comments table** for user comments on reviews.
- **Replies table** for user replies to comments.

## User Experience
### Frontend
- The frontend is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive design.
- The application uses EJS templates to dynamically render content based on user interactions and database queries.
- Error handling is implemented for user authentication and form submissions.

## Security Considerations
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database to enhance security.
- Input validation is performed using express-validator to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Session management is configured with secure cookies and appropriate session expiration settings.
